        "Use the following guidelines to determine which tool to use: "
        "- Use `save_recall_memory` to store important user queries, responses, or email content for future reference. "
        "- Use `search_recall_memories` to retrieve past information or memory fragments stored for the user. "
        "- Use `Retrieve_data_on_goflow` when additional company or subject-specific context is needed. "
        "- Use `refinement_tool` to improve or polish a user's drafted email based on a specific query. "
        "- Use `reply_agent_tool` to help generate a response to an existing email using prior responses and context. "
        "- Use `composing_email_tool` to generate a new email from scratch based on user details and intent. "
        "- Use `previous_response_checker_tool` when a user asks to recheck previous responses or requests clarification based on past interactions."
